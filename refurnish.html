                    <h1>Where is the need?</h1>


                    <p>

                        This was the final project done at BrainStation UX Bootcamp. I partnered up with fellow UBC
                        student Veronica to create a mobile app Refurnish. We talked about the growing housing crisis
                        and the difficulties of owning or even renting a home. Although we are not ready to tackle on
                        such a big crisis, we put our focus on something that may help reduce the problem.
                        <br><br>
                        We noticed
                        how expensive furniture was so we thought if there was a possible market for used furniture
                        marketplace. We looked at variety of online marketplaces such as Etsy, Kijiji, and
                        Craigslist. <strong>Many items did not have enough pictures to clearly see the whole product and
                            there
                            wasn’t enough protection for possible scams.</strong> Another thing we noticed is how people
                        would just dump broken down furniture in the street hoping someone would pick it up. Through
                        user research, we hope to
                        discover more
                        required features and tackle some of the problems.

                    <p>

                        We realized these big marketplaces lacked proper categories for furniture. In addition to
                        designing for trust, we want to ensure safety and privacy for both buyers and sellers. Features
                        we want to include are <strong>general location of the seller for privacy, minimum number of
                            pictures of
                            furniture required to give buyers a better visual, and have a delivery system for big and
                            heavy
                            furniture. </strong> We also looked at recycling for furniture that is not usable.

                    <p>

                        We originally had three target markets: college students, new families, and home designers. We
                        looked for their main needs and concerns for a furniture marketplace app. Cost, privacy, and
                        safety were the main concerns for both college students and new families. However, we found out
                        that home designers find the app not to their interests due to their clients not being
                        interested in buying used furniture.

                        Personas were very important to see what our users would want. Due to my lack of knowledge in
                        buying/selling furniture, I was able to keep an open mind when asking questions. Again,
                        <strong>privacy
                            and safety </strong> were the main concerns. <strong>Key frustration was to travel to a
                            desired location only to see the seller has not mentioned that the product is
                            damaged"</strong> So, one of our
                        features is to ensure sellers upload at least four pictures to clearly showcase their product.

                        Understanding users’ pain points were our big focus. We made compromises after interviews trying
                        to balance between creating an account and uploading to just wanting to browse first. We made
                        sure users are promoted to register only when the user commits to creating an ad or purchasing
                        an item. To make sure our users' safety takes top priority, sellers have to create an account
                        before uploading to the app.

                    <p>
                        I find my passion in UX design from wireframing & prototyping. I enjoyed the constant
                        changes of
                        frames through the non-stop user testing. The app is for the users so I tried my best
                        not to
                        have any personal bias in our designs. Granted, I believe this project was a positive
                        for me due
                        to my lack of initial knowledge with used marketplaces. We wanted to create a clean,
                        minimalistic home page where the bottom navigation would only show if the user scrolls
                        so it
                        does not block the screen.

                        Through user testing, we realized the “plus icon” just wasn’t intuitive enough if the
                        user wants
                        to recycle their furniture. Adding a separate recycle icon also cluttered the user
                        interface.
                        So, we added action icons, again which would pop when the user stops scrolling. We had
                        the
                        action buttons on the right due to most people were right-handed. In the future, we
                        should add
                        options to have it on the left for left-handed users.

                        Through
                        user testing, users tried to keep swiping but once you reached a limit in our first

                        you can only swipe left. So, we made users be able to swipe until the user does not feel

                            ad.</strong> In
                        addition, we gave options for both pick and delivery. Delivery will be done with a local
                        company
                        at an extra fee for their services. For extra caution, we made PayPal our only option of
                        payment. Through user interviews, PayPal had the best protection against scams and were
                        widely
                        used.

                        Have a large vehicle? Or don’t want to pay the extra cost for delivery? We made the app
                        easy for
                        users to pick up as well. Like many online marketplaces, we allowed for easy
                        communication
                        between buyers and sellers. Sellers can set a schedule for buyers to pick their best
                        times.

                        Buyer’s main concern was possible damaged product that may be sold off as new. By having
                        a

                    <p>
                        Never stop iterating. What I enjoy about UX is to never be afraid of user feedback and be always
                        willing to adapt and make changes. Initially, we wanted “Recycle” to be one of our focus for
                        users.
                        However, most users were confused if it was part of the logo or an icon. They were uncertain if
                        it
                        was clickable. <br><br>
                        Additionally, many did not put recycling as their top priority in using our app, but prefer
                        browsing
                        more. Also, many users commented that our bottom navigation was distracting even if it would
                        only
                        show up when the user stops scrolling. So, we decided to remove the bottom navigation in favour
                        of
                        the hamburger menu.<br><br>
                        Adding a single icon on top of the search bar created confusion among users, so we decided to
                        remove
                        them all together and put them all in the hamburger menu. We also squished the top navigation to
                        remove even more visual clutter. Again, we have a single action icon as users are more likely to
                        sell furniture rather than recycle them.

                        Taking the BrainStation UX course was a great experience. The instructors were all very
                        helpful
                        in
                        guiding us to be better UX designers. I enjoyed spending weeks constantly iterating and
                        iterating
                        again through user testing and improving our app to meet user needs.
                        <br><br>
                        In the future, we could have
                        made our app more user friendly by adding options for left-handed users. Also, for extra
                        precaution,
                        we should have added phone verification in addition to just creating an account. Another
                        thing
                        to
                        note was whether if we wanted home type option or not. Some users prefer the extra
                        privacy of
                        only
                        disclosing to buyers if they ask for it while pickup buyers wanted to know the type of
                        home the
                        sellers lived in such as a four-story apartment with no elevator. We decided to have the
                        home
                        type
                        disclosed between the chat communication rather than forced option during the creation
                        of an ad.
