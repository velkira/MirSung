                    <h1>Where is the need?</h1>


                    <p>

                        With the recent outbreak and high chances of bars and restaurants closing, people will be
                        relying on homecooked meals instead. College students, especially those who live on dorms have
                        to use their own cooking skills to survive.
                        <br><br>
                        Now, there are many recipe style apps. Tasty is a
                        very well-known app that has a huge variety of menus from simple to difficult with many users.
                        Through both user research and personal experience, I realized despite there are many recipes
                        and menu apps available, many are still unwilling to cook their own meals despite being cheaper
                        and healthier.
                        <br><br>
                        I checked local grocery delivery services and they lacked international choices and was
                        restricted to general items, in addition to being costly.

                    </p>

                    <h2>Problem 1: Time</h2>

                    <p>

                        Home cooking just takes too long. When you are new or lack the resources, it is difficult to
                        cook fast. When you have commuters having to commute to work and back taking 2+ hours and
                        spending additional hours not only cooking for food, and shopping for groceries can be both
                        frustrating and tiring.
                    </p>



                    <p>

                        The first part has been “solved” by many recipe apps by categorizing them into simple or 1-pan
                        dishes. Tasty for example has their own videos to help out new cooks.
                        <br><br>
                        My app will be user generated. Users can either upload their own videos or someone else’s with
                        credit and links such as from YouTube. Users can also comment and share recipes, videos, and
                        comments.

                    </p>


                    <p>
                        Unlike other apps, my app would not be mainly a recipe finder. Its main goal is to save as much
                        time as possible. Fridgit will be refrigerator tracker. Users input all their groceries to store
                        as
                        data in the app. Using that data, the app will categorize the recipes that fits best with the
                        ingredients currently own. If a user pick a recipe, the app will then create a list of items
                        users do not yet have in the fridge.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Problem 2: Cost</h2>

                    <p>

                        Eating out for food that is healthy tends to be more expensive than cooking at home in terms of
                        money. Eating out saves people of time. Using this app, I want users to save as much time as
                        possible.
                    </p>



                    <p>

                        Users can save money through various means due to the app’s convenience. Users can save gas by
                        not
                        having to travel back and forth to check if they have items or not. In addition, money can be
                        saved because users won’t be over buying items just in case if they do not have the items at
                        home.
                        Which means not only users save money, but users also save the cost of time.

                    <h2>Who are they?</h2>
                    <p>

                        The target market will generally be young adults living alone wanting to eat healthier and save
                        money. However, due to app’s versatility of being both a recipe app and a shopping list app, the
                        app can potentially be used for family cooks as well. Again, knowing exactly what is missing
                        and/or need to buy more of has been a cost-effective solution for all users.

                    <h1>User pain points </h1>
                    <h2>How can they be solved?</h2>


                    <p>

                        I interviewed five students and on average, it takes them 50 minutes to cook which includes
                        preparation time. This is not including the time to get groceries, travel time, and doing the
                        dishes. Adding the total average time, it goes to almost 90 minutes.

                        <br><br>
                        I have also interviewed two mothers who cook for their kids. Their average time is a lot shorter
                        with 30 minutes of preparations and cooking. Their total time was 55 minutes. However, their
                        total time is a bit skewed due to only two samples and they both owned vehicles. In addition,
                        the mothers cooked for the family of four unlike the individual for the five students.

                        <br><br>
                        The college students were not experienced in actual cooking. If they were to cook at home, it
                        relied on using as little ingredients as possible such as using Spam, eggs, rice, and ramen.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The goal of the app is to tackle the two main pain points for both living alone young adults and
                        adults cooking for their families:
                    </p>
                    <h2>Time</h2>

                    <p>
                        Reduce the time it takes to cook to match those who are experienced by having user-generated
                        recipes. The recipes can be rated by their amount of likes and the user’s current groceries. In
                        addition, the app can record user items at home so users can precisely buy what they need and
                        don’t have to ponder.
                    </p>

                    <h2>
                        Cost
                    </h2>

                    <p>


                        Motivating young adults to cook at home already saves them money since eating out is more
                        expensive.
                        Those who have to second guess or forget, do not have to worry about overbuying or forgetting to
                        buy
                        a necessary ingredient. The app has the potential to save traveling back and forth.

                    </p>

                    <p>

                        I wanted the sitemap as flat as possible. Because users are from all ages, I needed least amount
                        of complications – meaning least amount of clicks to get to what the users want.

                    <p>

                        After more user research, I came to a point where I am asking myself is potentially saving 35
                        minutes enough to use the app itself? Experienced home cookers still take 55 minutes to prepare
                        food compare to going out where Users can just relax and don’t have to prepare and do the
                        dishes. It can be even faster if users order takes out.
                        <br><br>

                        In addition, manually inputting items as users buy groceries seem really intensive. There are so
                        many opportunities for error when users manually input variety of numbers and letters. These can
                        all cause frustration which will lead to the uninstallation of the app.

                        So, what can be solved?

                    <p>
                        Smartphones have the technology to scan text from images. Apps such as Zoho Expense and
                        Expensify can scan receipt and record data. However, they are known to take a long time to
                        process due to their focus on accuracy. However, for Fridgit, price is not important. There is
                        another problem. Not all stores provide amount in their receipts. Which means users still have
                        to manually input the weight or amount of the item.
                        <br><br>
                        Scans will be fast if they only focus on the text of the grocery item and nothing else. Several
                        apps that focus solely on cashbacks by scanning receipts also have fast process time.
                        So now I have to decide how to implement the amount to the food that does not frustrate the
                        user. So, more user research and interviews are required, but here are some possible solutions:
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        Solution 1:
                    </h2>

                    <p>
                        Implement the manual input. This solution will have the highest potential for problematic issues
                        for the user. Users have to spend more time on the app instead of doing actual cooking and
                        buying groceries, but will have the best accuracy.

                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        Solution 2:
                    </h2>
                    <p>

                        Having options are good. Still have the manual input as a possible option.
                        A step by step guide from shopping to cooking if user has missing items from storage:

                    </p>
                    <ol class="steplist" type="1">
                        <li> Pick a recipe </li>

                        <li> Create a shopping list for the missing items</li>
                        <li> Scan the receipt after purchase</li>
                        <li> The app stores the item with the amount being optional for manually inputted by the user
                        </li>
                        <li> User cooks using the recipe</li>
                        <li>After a short period of time, an alert pops up asking the user if the items user for the
                            recipe has been used up, if so, the app removes the item from storage</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>

                        This way, the user does not have to input amount such as 5lbs or 22lbs into the app. Because the
                        cooking session has been very recent, the user can remember if they used up their groceries or
                        not.
                        <br><br>
                        However, there is still the problem of individually checking off the items used. Granted, it is
                        a lot easier than manually inputting items, but if a receipt is using over 10 items, it will be
                        tiring to tap 10 times.

                    </p>

                    <h2>
                        So how can this be solved?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        I have to go back and think about what exactly is my market. Perhaps family cooks are not it.
                        Both interviewees used 10+ items to cook for their families. But with additional research, I
                        realized there is a common relationship with all cooks and potential cooks – the category of
                        seasoning and sauce such as salt and soy sauce. If those items were put into separate
                        categories, the cooks would have 5 to 7 items at most such as the main meat and some vegetables.
                        Eggs, butter, and garlic were popular ingredients in many dishes. The difficulty is how would I
                        categorize those items? For now, I can give the user a selection to check off all the items in
                        one tap.
                    </p>

                    <h2>
                        Lingering problems
                    </h2>

                    <p>
                        Despite all these little solutions, time wise, take outs and eating out will still be faster.
                        Dishes are always going to be a problem. The time to do dishes will always be part of the
                        cooking process. No app would be able eliminate the problem. Users will still have to shop and
                        prepare their meals. Again, the key here is to motivate those on the margin to go for cheaper
                        alternatives from eating out by cooking at home – making the process easy and non-frustrating.

                    <p>
                        For now, I would like to design apps where I can develop it myself. Tabscanner and Taggun are
                        possible choices to integrate with the app – assuming I can pay the fees. With some research,
                        there isn’t seem to be open source API for a receipt scanner, so there may be some difficulties
                        building the scanning side of the app from scratch. Realistically, I would have both manual
                        input and a categorical option with a search function to store items.

                    <p>
                        Since I have a background in both development and business, I came to another wall with the app.
                        I looked for some receipt scanner software online and on average, the cost to use was generally
                        around $20 to $50 USD per month. Granted, the ones I was able to find, the software’s main
                        purpose was for organization of receipts for tax. In addition, since they were for tax reasons,
                        it was based on per user. So as of right now, there isn’t a software that is tailored for
                        Fridgit’s use. Meaning, I most likely have to develop it. This means I can save money at the
                        cost of my time.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Pricing model</h2>
                    <p>
                        Generally, best way for an app with no marketing is using the free model with ads. If an app
                        doesn’t have a lot of downloads, it wont’ be able to generate high ad revenue. Meaning, it is
                        better to develop the scanner portion myself or I would be losing money. A lot of developers
                        have premium models where users pay at a one-time cost for no ads. You also need to make the
                        cost worth it. Even if you charge as low as $1, it is surprisingly a huge commitment for many
                        due to so many apps being free.

                    <p>
                        Another problem I have encountered is customer retention. Through user research, I know that
                        frequent home cooks do not need this app due to their experience. My target market is mostly the
                        ones on the margin, wanting to get into home cooking hoping to save money and change their
                        lifestyles. So once a user uses the app to a certain point, they would no longer need to use the
                        app – resulting in a deletion.

                    <p>
                        Once the users become good cooks, they may turn into content creators. Instead of using the app
                        to learn, they can create videos and recipes to be uploaded to the app. Due to the app’s rating
                        system, it is not surprising for people to voluntarily do something for arbitrary scores.
                        However, a problem with this is they may go into other ventures such as YouTube for actual
                        monetary gains. Perhaps a tipping feature need to be added to add extra incentive.

                        Through more research and interviews, it is getting more difficult to justify the current
                        direction of the app. Perhaps the app is too complicating trying to do too many things at once
                        and lacks a clear goal. At the same time, users do not want to juggle multiple apps. I may need
                        to go back and change my approach on asking the right questions. The recipe side of the app the
                        users do not seem to have a problem with since it is a common feature and idea. The problem is
                        the scanning and storing data side.

                        I asked people who use planners both app and notebook users. Although I only got four people,
                        there seems to be a relationship with those who plan things and being a good cook. They plan
                        ahead. Meaning they generally won’t forget what they have in the fridge and they know what to
                        plan for their next meal – so they would not need to use the app at all.

                    <p>
                        Those who need the app are hindered by the data storage side due to the long process. However,
                        attempting to reduce the tasks required meant that there is a big monetary cost in development
                        resulting in forcing features such as premium models, more ads, or donations that can hinder
                        user retention. This concludes that more research is needed to be done to somehow streamline the
                        process of inputting individual shopping items onto the phone without huge development costs
                        while not hindering user experience – which seems to be the biggest challenge.

                            I wanted to see if there is a relationship between those who cook often and those who plan.
                            From a small sample size from user interviews, I noticed those who plan their daily lives
                            and use a calendar to plan their schedules tend to enjoy cooking. So, I hypothesized that
                            those who use a calendar or a notebook, cooks often than not.

                        <p>
                            I was able to gather some light data among my Facebook group and possibly others. I needed
                            large amount of data quickly. From personal experience, students generally don’t like doing
                            surveys, especially when it is too long. So, I made the survey have only three questions.
                            The third question is added so participants cannot easily guess the hypothesis. I also made
                            sure the participants have to think back to January where the outbreak did not have an
                            affect due to the possible quarantine.
                            <br><br>
                            I used Google surveys and shared among Facebook. Participants are males and females aged 20
                            to 30 and students from various institutions. Because I wanted my survey to be done quickly,
                            the participant data itself is very general. If I wanted a more thorough research, I would
                            have asked for gender and age, and if living alone, roommates, SOs, or family. Income would
                            be another thing to ask.

                            3 or less times a week generally do not use a calendar device. Of course, we cannot say the

                        The major problem is that those who are motivated and want to start cooking will get
                        frustrated when they have to input data daily. It’s not something they are used to doing.
                        Meaning the long process will most likely have them to give up the app. In addition, those
                        who are comfortable inputting and writing down their schedule, would not need the app. For
                        the next step, I would have to create a prototype for the recipe scanner process to see how
                        the users will like it and if it’s enough for them to actually use it.
